# Lab 7 - Deployments of Code in GitHub Repos


## Overview

This lab shows how to deploy applications from Git repositories. 

This deployment option checks whether a Dockerfile exist. With the Dockerfile a build on OpenShift is initiated. Since we use a Dockerfile with two stages, both the Java binary is built as well as the Docker image.

Note that Kubernetes yaml files are ignored with this approach.

Read the [documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/new_app.html#specifying-source-code) for more details.

### Step 1

In the Cloud Shell make sure you are using your own project:

```
$ oc project
```

### Step 2

Create a new application and refer to the GitHub repo of this workshop and to a subdirectory (deploying-to-openshift) within the repo:

```
$ oc new-app https://github.com/Harald-U/openshift43-on-ibm-cloud-workshop --context-dir=deploying-to-openshift --name=authors-git
```

As result you'll get this output.

Notice how OpenShift creates a number of Kubernetes and OpenShift objects without you having to create any yaml files. Port 3000 is read from the Dockerfile.

A build will be triggered and run on OpenShift.

After successful build (Status: 'Complete') the pod and the service (and a build) will be deployed.

### Step 3

In the last step in Cloud Shell create a route.

```
$ oc expose svc/authors-git
$ oc get route/authors-git
```

To test the deployment, append '/openapi/ui' to the URL in the output of 'oc get route/authors-git' and open it in a browser.

This is the deployed application with the route.
